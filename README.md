# MIDIGrabber

MIDIGrabber - A small utility to grab note/velocity/CC data from MIDI devices in real time. Originally designed to be used with Mixxx for controller mapping, but there are all sorts of practical applications!

Currently this is Linux-only, but most likley runs under WSL on Windows (macOS version coming eventually).
